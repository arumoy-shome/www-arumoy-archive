This page contains links to some of my writings on topics that
interest me. Usually, they are inspired by problems that I experience
in my day-to-day life.

I like pondering over the act or the process of doing something.

To search my website using keywords, use a search engine. For
instance, in Google you can type `site:arumoy.me` followed by
your keywords to search within my blog posts. Your milage may vary as
I don't perform any SEO optimisation so the search engine may not have
indexed all my pages.
