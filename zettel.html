<p>
This is my personal knowledge base. Captured ideas, thoughts,
observations from my journal get assimilated on a weekly basis. If I
find something worthwhile, I take the time to elaborate on it. The
result, is the information contained in this document.
</p>

<p>
I have yet to figure out the procedure for organization and retrieval.
I will get there, but in the mean time what is important is the
information itself.

<h2 id="orgdeae8e2">Notes on privacy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdeae8e2">
<p>
There are a lot of independent, privacy focused companies poping up
who are pushing their privacy preserving products. However, there is
no guarantee that they will remain independent in the future. There is
also the possibility of them getting bought by larger corporations or
simply going bankrupt.
</p>

<p>
There is a trade-off between privacy and utility. One suffers while
emphasis is put on the other. I am fully aware that I am paying for
the functionality provided by products such as Google with my data. I
am okay with this because:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Large companies such as Google/Apple have a lot to lose if
they have security breaches</li>
<li>They do not have a history of catastrophic security breaches</li>
<li>They are transparent about how my data is being used and so-far
they have not abused my data</li>
</ol>

<p>
Knowing the above, I opt to keep my data centralised within select
companies whome I trust, in return for superior functionality.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8525c7c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8525c7c">Research workflow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8525c7c">
<p>
Here I outline a workflow which I have developed to handle the
non-linear nature of scientific research. There are days when one
reads several papers without making much sense of them. However, a
single paper the next day can result in a clear picture of the domain.
The workflow acknowledges the fact that there are many more failures
rather than successes in research. However, a failure is still an
outcome - and this is what helps us decide what to do next - so it
should still be recorded.
</p>

<p>
There are 3 interdependent phases to this process described below.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org23cd321" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org23cd321">Finding papers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org23cd321">
<p>
I save the bibtex entry in a bib file (generally in the project root
along with the other latex files). This is because the bibtex-mode in
emacs provides powerful search options, templates for adding entries,
sorting entries, cleaning up, and much more. Besides, the bib files
ultimately gets used in the report so it makes sense to group the two
together and keep them in the same location.
</p>

<p>
First, I use good ol' Google Scholar (along with a plugin to enable my
institution's proxy) to find papers. Once, I find a paper I open it
and read the abstract. If the abstract appeals to my current research
focus or is interesting to me in general, I download it and save it in
a folder which syncs across my devices. Next, I grab the bibtex entry
and create a task using org-capture where I save the bibtex entry, one
liner on why I found the paper interesting. I add the location to the
pdf on disk, I set the title of the task as the bibtex entry and I
save it to my <i>inbox</i> (or relevant project org file). I use
<code>org-capture</code> along with this <a href="https://github.com/arumoy-shome/emacs.d/blob/master/org-templates/paper.txt">template</a> to automate this process.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6a01501" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6a01501">Reading papers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6a01501">
<p>
I read the papers on my laptop. My screen is usually split 50-50
between Emacs (where I take notes) and a pdf viewer. I do not make any
highlights because its easy to abuse and it ties the information to
the pdf viewer application that I am using.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I take notes in plaintext (as of 2020, I have been using
org-mode, an Emacs major mode to do so). There are several, rationales
for doing this digitally. First, I require these notes to be
searchable and linkable to other notes. Second, research projects
often span for long durations. Having digital notes ensures that I do
not have notes distributed amongst several analog papers/journals.
Lastly, I take notes on papers in a specific manner. These notes have
a specific purpose - and thus a carefully constructed structure as
described in the next section - and thus come under the category of
<i>hard</i> information (see <a href="#org0881908">Categories of Information</a>).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf058d92" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf058d92">Writing notes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf058d92">
<p>
Notes on paper being read will always be in relation to the current
research focus/goal. A paper may be read multiple times but will have
different notes if they were made with reference to different
research questions.
</p>

<p>
Following this rationale, I store the notes in the corresponding
project files (see LINKME) whilst storing the pdfs in a central
location, synced with a cloud service provider.
</p>

<p>
Following are the aspects that I look out for when reading papers:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>problem statement</dt><dd>What is the problem the paper is trying to
solve? why is this problem important? why should I care? This
generally leads to a good material for the introduction of my
paper as well.</dd>
<dt>solution</dt><dd>What is the solution the paper proposes? how is it
better/compared to existing ones (do the authors try to show its
worth by comparing to existing solutions)? why should I care about
it?</dd>
<dt>results</dt><dd><p>
What were the analytical experiments conducted and
what were their results? what datasets were used? what models
were used and how did they perform? how were their performance
evaluated?
</p>

<p>
Generally, in my field these questions can be answered by reading
the Results section, very rarely are results disclosed in the
conclusion section. Note that falls out of the 'first pass'
content so I may come back to this only if I need this information
for the task at hand.
</p></dd>
<dt>limitations</dt><dd>Does the paper identify its limitations? what
future work can be done?</dd>
</dl>

<p>
After writing down notes on the topics above, I try to write a one
line summary of the paper along with my remarks. These are always
guided by the research question or work at hand. This is also why I
prefer <b>not</b> to make dedicated notes.
</p>

<p>
The "why should I care?" flavor questions will generally be guided by
the research question or personal interest that I may have at the time
of reading.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4599429" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4599429">Knowledge</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4599429">
<p>
This document captures the various domains/skills that I wish to
learn, understand and utilize. The main motivation for doing this is
because lately I have been feeling quite "stale" when it comes to the
knowledge I possess. I have noticed that the shape of my knowledge no
longer resembles a "T" but rather an "I", ie. I have developed a
tunnel vision and only seek new information in the realm of computer
science, text editors, note taking and productivity. Another reason is
that I wish to be a well rounded person, with the ability to partake
in any forms of discussions and impart a little nugget of information
or anecdote which nobody else knew about.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc07df90" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc07df90">Areas of interest</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc07df90">
<p>
Here I list the areas which I am naturally interested or feel the need
to improve upon.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>General knowledge</dt><dd>Mainly world geography, current affairs, well
known locations/destinations on Earth, that sort of thing. One way
to improve is to read/watch the news regularly. Another is this
trick I found on reddit where people suggested to make this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random/Good_article">url</a> the
default homepage of the web browser. The url opens a random "Good
Article" on Wikipedia. I have taken it a step further and also
created a shortcut to this page on my phone.</dd>
<dt>History</dt><dd>I am not familiar with the major world events and
important historic eras.</dd>
<dt>Economics &amp; Business</dt><dd>Might be covered by watching the news
regularly. Also another suggestion (which requires a steady income)
is to subscribe to The Economist magazine.</dd>
<dt>General Science</dt><dd>I have already been interested in the natural
sciences, it's good to keep the basics handy for solutions to
day-to-day problems (I am an engineer at heart after all).</dd>
<dt>Philosophy</dt><dd>This one depends on the above so I will hold off on
this until I have possessed a sufficient knowledge of the rest.</dd>
<dt>Fitness &amp; Nutrition</dt><dd>For optimal operations of the mind, one
requires a well maintained body and a good, clean source of fuel. I
have developed a habit of regular exercise but could benefit from
learning about simple, quick and healthy meals to prepare when I am
under a time crunch.</dd>
<dt>Music</dt><dd>I want to learn the basics of music theory, composition and
of course improve my skills as a drummer. I already have purchased a
subscription to the online resource Drumeo, I just need to make it a
habit to practise the old and learn new rudiments throughout the
week. Perhaps once I have a stable income, I can invest in a
personal teacher.</dd>
<dt>Linguistics</dt><dd>I am fascinated by language, the similarities and
dissimilarities between words from different languages, the history
and development of a language and so forth.</dd>
<dt>Space</dt><dd>What is beyond this planet? Whom do we share this universe
with? I have always believed that we cannot be the sole inhabitants
of this universe. This is a broad topic which covers quantum
physics, quantum computing, astronomy and
astro-{chemistry,biology,physics}.</dd>
</dl>

<div id="outline-container-org2ef9f12" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2ef9f12">Practical recommendations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2ef9f12">
<p>
Here I list some recommendations for cultivating new areas of
interests and making a habit of learning through deliberate
practise.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Find online resources to read "on the go". By this I mean
websites, online communities, blogs, etc which are short articles
and can be read on a mobile device.</li>
<li>Find resources (online or otherwise) to study from. For topics
which require a sit down, pen and paper, a good book or an online
course is required.</li>
<li>Make quantitative goals. So that progress in each topic can be
tracked. One idea would be to take up projects in the various
topics to make the learning more engaging.</li>
<li>Make a daily/weekly/monthly practise. Just how I have developed a
practise to review my week, I should implement strategies to make
practising drum rudiments or learning Dutch periodically and
repetitively.</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-org1ec3591" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1ec3591">Productivity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1ec3591">
<p>
Productivity to me comes from proper information management.
Information can come in many forms: email, thoughts/ideas, deadlines,
events, project planning, online links, and many more.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0881908" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0881908">Categories of Information</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0881908">
<p>
I categorize information into two broad categories:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Soft</dt><dd>these are bits of information which have a temporary life
span. They simply serve as a reminder to do something at a later
time or perhaps a scratch list for what groceries to by. Soft
information does not require to be stored permanently and can be
discarded once the serve their purpose. Soft information does
however require that they be captured quickly so that they do not
take up space in the limited capacity of our brains. The ability to
capture them should also be available to us at all times, under any
circumstances, provided we have access to pen+paper or an electronic

interest, project updates and planning, thoughts and ideas worth
investigating. Hard information must be searchable (and thus
digital) and linkable to one another (so that we can form
connections). Hard information should be preserved and must
contribute to an ever growing body of knowledge. Finally, hard
information should be sharable (in pdf or html) with others (another
reason why they should be digital).</dd>

I have used many productivity tips, techniques, applications and other
forms of nonsense over the years. the one thing which has stuck with
me and have proven to work time and time again is the simple, two
phase act of:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>capturing information as quickly as possible, and</li>
<li>reviewing and progressive summarization of the information later at
a designated time.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I think this works for several reasons, first being that it is utterly
simple. second, it enforces deliberate practise of sitting down and
reflecting, and writing which enriches and exercises the ultimate
productivity tool which we possess: our brain.

I find that absolutely nothing can beat a pen and a paper for this job
(see <a href="#org23d9a70">Benefits of writing on paper</a>).
</p>

<p>
For the rare occasions when pen and paper cannot do the job (such as
saving a link to an online article to be read later or when we are on
the move), a digital solution is required. Any app will do, as long as
it has a "quick capture" mechanism (most todo apps do these days). You
can also simply email yourself if you prefer not to have another
dependency, another moving part, another "cog" in your system.

<p>
Now that I have captured information, what do we do with it? 90% of it
is just noise and there is a fine line between expanding knowledge and
hoarding knowledge. Here, I find it important to maintain a reference
of sort to determine what is important and what is not.
</p>

<p>
I find that writing on paper acts as a natural buffer to 'noise'.
</p>

<p>
I review my notes on a weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly basis.
The goal of each review is to progressively summarise the captured
ideas. So, weekly reviews summarize daily logs, monthly reviews
summarize the weekly reviews, and so on and so forth. This progressive
summarization is a deliberate practise of writing that allows me to
develop my ideas.

When I am studying or trying to understand a concept, I want free
flow, I want independence to sketch, to write text or a mathematical
equation. Digital mediums will not work here because they enforce a
structure, but at this stage I do not have any structure! I simply
have many ideas which I must assimilate and process, arrangement comes
later when I review my notes.
</p>

<p>
Capturing thoughts and ideas on paper also has benefits. It adds the
perfect quantity of resistance and acts as a natural buffer to
'noise'.

<p>
The migration of an analog note to digital system enforces deliberate
progressive summarization of the note.

Github requires a <code>CNAME</code> file in the directory from which the
website should be served. Now, the <code>github-pages</code> gem can be used
to instruct Github Pages (GHP) to automatically build and serve the
website.
</p>

<p>
But I faced several challenges getting the compatible versions of the
<code>github-pages</code>, <code>jekyll</code> and ruby to match.
</p>

<p>
So, either I build my website using Jekyll from scratch (back to
square one) or I give up this nonsense and just use simple HTML+CSS to
build my site (see <a href="#org0dc2e16">Notes on responsive web design</a>) using org to write
and org-publish to generate the HTML pages (see <a href="#org2774f9d">org-publish</a>).

the fact that it just worked out of the box was a pleasant surprise.

There are 4 areas to keep in mind:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>responsive content: use flexbox and grid for this (media queries
are a thing of the past)</li>
<li>responsive images: always <code>max-width: 100%;</code> so that images
scale based on the parent</li>
<li>responsive typography: use a combination of <code>vw</code> and <code>rem</code> units
to scale text on screen</li>
<li><p>
viewport meta tag: always set it to the following
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-html">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"&gt;
</pre>

<h2 id="orge506919">Emacs <code>PATH</code> and <code>exec-path</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge506919">
<p>
Emacs maintains its own copy of the <code>PATH</code> variable which it copies
over from the shell. However, on OSX it does not copy the paths set
by <code>libexe</code>, but only the ones explicitly set in the shell config
files.
</p>

<p>
The <code>exec-path</code> is a list which Emacs uses to look for programs
(such as find, grep, etc). Emacs documentation claims to set this up
from <code>PATH</code> but this does not seem to be case (at least on OSX).
</p>

<p>
So the simplest solution I have come across (as of
<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2020-09-14 Mon 20:27]</span></span>) is to set them up manually. See
<a href="https://github.com/arumoy-shome/emacs.d/blob/master/aru/aru-path.el">aru-path.el</a> for details.

Others seem to write a function to do this, I find that dired works
just as well for me (one less piece of elisp code to write/worry
about). I have <code>C-x C-j</code> mapped to <code>dired-jump</code> which takes me to
the directory containing the current file. Next, I can use dired's
built in functionality to delete/rename files which automatically
update the corresponding buffer.

<p>
I like to use python's builtin virtualenv package to manage virtual
environments for my projects. Typically, I create a virtualenv per
project and activate it with the <code>source venv/bin/activate</code> shell
command (note that I always call my virtualenv venv, since it is
inside the project directory, there is no namespace collision).
</p>

<p>
I like the simplicity of the <code>activate</code> script, if you look at the
source code, you find that all it does is append a certain directory
to the <code>$PATH</code> environment variable such that the <code>python</code>
executable from the virtualenv is picked up by the system.
</p>

<p>
I dislike tools such as pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv simply because
they are external dependencies which I may not have on remote
machines and second because they add to my shell's startup time.
</p>

<p>
In emacs, each buffer has a local value for the <code>default-directory</code>
variable, which is set to the directory in which the file exists.
This is a very reasonable default and should not be changes to
perhaps the project root directory because other commands such as
<code>find-file</code> depend on it.
</p>

<p>
The manual way to start a python process is to open a dired buffer
at the project root, and then issuing the <code>run-python</code> command with
a universal argument (<code>C-u C-c C-p</code> if you want to do it the
keybinding way). This is the simplest solution as it requires zero
config on emacs and shell side.
</p>

<p>
In the future, I would like to automate this, perhaps the
functionality can be wrapped in a <code>aru/run-python</code> function.

I am aware of <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby">chruby</a> and <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install">ruby-install</a> projects which allow one to
manage and install multiple ruby versions respectively. However, not
being a ruby developer, I do not have such a use case and wish to
circumvent the complexity that comes with such tools.
</p>

<p>
My requirements for ruby (as of <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2021-01-29 Fri]</span></span>) is simply to build
my personal website which uses Jekyll.
</p>

<p>
As such, I opt to install ruby via Homebrew. This has a slight
drawback that is, it requires me to manually add the location of the
'gems' and the <code>ruby</code> executable to the <code>PATH</code>.
</p>

<p>
The latter is easily done since brew keeps the latest executable at
<code>/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin</code>. The prior requires some more manual updates
everytime brew updates ruby since gems are stored at
<code>/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/x.x.x/bin</code> where the 'x's represent the
latest version of ruby.
</p>

<p>
I follow a similar strategy for Python (see ADDME). Also see notes on
<a href="#orge506919">Emacs <code>PATH</code> and <code>exec-path</code></a>.

<p>
Homebrew provides the <code>usr/local/opt/python@x.x/libexec/bin</code> directory
which contains unversioned executables for python and pip which are
correctly symlinked to the actual python@x.x executables.
</p>

<p>
I add this to system and emacs <code>PATH</code> (see
<a href="#orge506919">Emacs <code>PATH</code> and
<code>exec-path</code></a>). I prefer this to scripts such as
<a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv</a> since it adds to my shell
startup time.
