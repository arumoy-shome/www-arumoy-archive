Time and cost for gathering and annotating
functional MRI (fMRI) data for neurological diseases is immense.
Sharing medical data raises several privacy concerns, deidentified
does not guarantee privacy.

institutes have different scanners, different resolution, different
calibration, etc.

Paper describes a novel SGD algorithms which preserves patient
privacy. A rather micro approach in contrast to the macro approach of
distributed learning I have seen so far.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>problem statement</dt><dd>CNNs can easily memorize some aspects of the
dataset. When working with sensitive data, this violates the privacy
of the patient. Models are also susceptive to model inversion
attacks which can be used to reconstruct images in the training set
using the model parameters.</dd>
<dt>solution</dt><dd><p>
Paper proposes a novel SGD algorithm P3SGD for pathological
image classification. The method is based on differential privacy
and is able to reduce overfitting and obtain a level of privacy.
</p>

<p>
Past work in the field focus on protecting the privacy at the image
level. However most pathological databases contain several images
obtained from the same patient. The authors propose to achieve
privacy at the patient level which has the added benefit of reducing
overfitting.
</p></dd>

<dt>results</dt><dd><p>
Real pathology data used. Top performing CNNs are trained
using regular SGD and P3SGD and performance analysis conducted.
Analysis to show model trained with P3SGD is resistant to
model-inversion attacks.
</p>

<p>
Task is detecting presence of glomerulus (image classification).
Standard image feature engineering (random rotation, color
jittering), change in brightness and contrast and standardized image
size. Data distribution not mentioned. Analysis done over accuracy
of model.
</p>

<p>
The proposed method provides a new way to regularize deep CNNs,
authors have conducted analysis with popular regularization
techniques such as Dropout and Batch Normalization. This is a novel
regularization technique for neural networks specializing in
pathological image analysis.
</p></dd>
<dt>limitations</dt><dd>No limitations and future work proposed.</dd>
<dt>remarks</dt><dd>It would have been nice to see how P3SGD compares to
other optimization techniques such as AdaGrad and Adam. Only
accuracy was used, without data distribution it is hard to validate
legitimacy of reported results. No future work or limitations. Good
analysis done to show that their method prevent model-inversion
attacks. The method was tested with pathology images, further
research required to validate if it can be extended to other tasks.</dd>

<dt>problem statement</dt><dd><p>
centralized data contains personal information
such as images, videos and voice recordings. They are stored by
companies indefinitely, users do not have the ability to restrict
their usage. Recently privacy laws have been put in place to prevent
exploiting personal data.
</p>

<p>
But this restricts ability of medical institutes to apply deep
learning to medical research, or to share data with others for
collaborative research. They do no benefit from large-scale deep
learning.
</p></dd>
<dt>solution</dt><dd><p>
authors propose a system for distributed, privacy
preserving deep learning (first paper to propose Federated
Learning). Models are locally trained at individual medical sites
and selective model parameters are aggregated at a centralized
server. Most updated parameters are then downloaded from the central
server and used to update the local parameters. The system is
independent of the algorithm used, can accommodate any DL model.
</p>

<p>
selective parameter sharing results in a robust models which avoid
getting stuck in local minima due to input from all participants.
</p></dd>
<dt>results</dt><dd><p>
system was tested with MNIST and SVHN datasets for image
classification. Results similar to models trained on central,
insecure data.
</p>

<p>
The system is able to minimize the data leakage drastically since
now the leakage is indirect in the form of model parameters. The
authors show how Differential Privacy can be applied to reduce this
leakage further. A comparative analysis to demonstrate tradeoff
between privacy and accuracy is shown. With increased privacy the
accuracy falls however by increasing the number of participants and
the quantity of parameters shared, the results are similar to
standalone training.
</p></dd>
<dt>limitations</dt><dd>authors do not present limitations of system or
planned future work.</dd>
<dt>remarks</dt><dd>system not field tested, ie. with actual sensitive data
from medical imaging. No limitations or future work was presented.
The system achieve performance similar to standalone models only
when 90 participants are present, this may not be possible. all
analysis done using accuracy of models, without distribution of data
we cannot validate legitimacy of performance reported. fault
tolerance tests not performed.</dd>

<dt>problem statement</dt><dd><p>
DL models benefit from large scale data however
sensitive data such as medical data are protected by law. Thus
medical institutes face several challenges when sharing data, cannot
benefit from large scale deep learning.
</p>

<p>
shokri2015privacy proposed FL which tackles but privacy concerns.
However the system does not guarantee full privacy by itself. There
is a tradeoff between privacy and accuracy: sharing all local
gradients improves accuracy but violates privacy and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
The authors show that even a small quantity of leaked gradients
can be used to extract the training data.
</p></dd>
<dt>solution</dt><dd>authors propose an improvement by using homomorphic
encrypted (HE). All gradients are encrypted thus making it private,
as a result all the gradients can be stored on the central server
which boosts the accuracy. Since HE is used, the computation can
occur over encrypted data.</dd>

<dt>results</dt><dd><p>
promising results are obtained. The new system does not
leak any gradient to the parameter server and is able to achieve
same accuracy as unencrypted data.
</p>

<p>
The encryption adds communication overhead between participants and
parameter server. Analysis shows the overhead is less than 3 times
for MNIST and SVHN.
</p>

<p>
Accuracy tests are done on MNIST data and system is able to achieve
same accuracy as unencrypted data.
</p>

<p>
The tradeoff between accuracy-privacy now shifts to
efficiency-privacy. This is more scalable since efficiency can be
improved by using more compute power, dedicated programming,
hardware, etc.
</p></dd>
<dt>limitations</dt><dd>no limitations/future work mentioned by authors.</dd>
<dt>remarks</dt><dd>did not use medical data to test the system. Used a MLP
to conduct the classification and only reported accuracy without
mentioning data distribution. Good computation analysis done,
authors show that by increasing threads, the encryption/decryption
process can be reduced. Authors propose two encryption schemes
(Paillier-based and LWE-based) but only do analysis with LWE-based.</dd>

transfer learning. This is an alternative to FL where training is no
longer parallel.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>problem statement</dt><dd><p>
"DL has been used for detecting diabetic
retinopathy, classifying dermatological lesions, predicting
mutations in glioma and assessing medical records."
</p>

<p>
DL however requires a large quantity of data for training. This is
not always possible, especially for rare diseases. Training on such
datasets result in biased models.
</p>

<p>
Sharing data to a centralized location is not always feasible. Data
can be of really large size (high resolution images), legal and
ethical limitations and preference of institutes.
</p>

<p>
Distributed training is an appealing solution to this problem. There
are two types: 1. model averaging: separate models trained and their
weights averaged every few mini-batches and 2. asynchronous
stocastic gradient descent: separate models trained and gradients
aggregated at a centalized server. Both techniques increase the
complexity as models have to train in parallel and there is
heterogenity in network speeds and hardware of institutes making it
a logistically complex problem.
</p></dd>
<dt>solution</dt><dd><p>
Authors compare 3 synchronous learning techniques: model
ensemling (ME), single weight transfer (SWT) and cyclic weight
transfer (CWT). These techniques are slower than distributed
learning but avoids logistic complexity.
</p>

<p>
SWT means that model is trained at one site and fine tuned on the
rest, derived from transfer learning. CWT does SWT multiple times
meaning each site trains the model multiple times.
</p></dd>

<dt>results</dt><dd><p>
Models are trained on 3 datasets: retinal fundus images,
mammography and ImageNet. The authors compare performance of the
proposed learning techniques to centralized training.
</p>

<p>
All proposed techniques perform better than a model trained on a
single institute. In total, training at 4 institutions are
simulated.
</p>

<p>
SWT performs better than ME, and CWT performs the best and its
performance is similar to centralized training. No overfitting
occured in CWT even though the model was transferred to an institute
multiple times. Higher frequency of weight transfer resulted in
better performance compared to lower frequency of weight transfer.
</p>

<p>
Analysis done to determine optimal frequency of weight transfer.
Higher frequency adds to model training time, authors show that a
lower frequency performs just as well as centralized training.
</p>

<p>
Analysis done for robustness of CWT. Tests performed with and
without institute containing heterogeneous data: non standardized
quality/resolution/size of images and different quantity of images
per patient (representing real world data). CWT still able to
maintain accuracy as variability of data increased.
</p>

<p>
Analysis done on scalability of CWT. 6000 patient samples randomly
distributed across 20 simulated institutes. Authors ensure that the
performance of model is no better than random classification if
trained at single institute. Accuracy of model at par with
centralized training when model trained at all 20 institutes using
CWT.
</p></dd>
<dt>limitations</dt><dd><p>
All simulated institutes were sampled from the same
dataset: this does not match the domain difference observed in
reality. Authors addressed this by simulating variability: changed
resolution/size of images or low number of patients with class
imbalance. Authors propose to conduct future studies such that each
institute's data is derived from a unique patient population.
</p>

<p>
Model trained to perform binary classification, require further
analysis to determine the added complexity for multi-label
classification.
</p>

<p>
Authors only studied CNNs, and wish to study other networks such as
GANs, RNNs and autoencoders.
</p>

<p>
Authors address the limitation of CWT that as number of institutes
increase, the total training time increases. Also, we do not control
the hardware and network speeds of the institutes. At such cases,
distributed training may be more feasible. Further analysis to be
done to determine this threshold.
</p></dd>
<dt>remarks</dt><dd><p>
Really well written paper, hardly anything lacking. One
thing, it would have been nice to see some runtime performance
evaluation. Comparision of runtime and communication overhead with
FL would help as we scale number of participants. This would help
determine the threshold after which FL becomes more feasible.
</p>

<p>
Resiliance testing would also help. For instance, what happens if an
institute drops out? Are there redundancies built into the system?
Does each institute persist its model until entire training cycle
has completed? Can training resume from the previous institute if
current institute drops out?
</p>

<p>
Solution only addresses data governance issues, system still prone
to security threats and attacks.

Paper presents a distributed learning platform which utilizes DP for
preserving the privacy. There is no analysis done on the data leakage
of FL, so this paper can only be used for RQ1.

Several evidence exist on the effectiveness of
large scale DL for medical tasks. Centralized data repositories such
as eICU Collaborative Research Database and The Cancer Genome Atlas
exist. But these centralized data stores involve a laborious task of
deidentification of patient info from the images. The
deidentification may also compromise the utility of the images
themselves.
</p>

<p>
Distributed Learning acknowledges these limitations however they are
not inherently privacy preserving and need to be combined with other
solutions.

Cyclic weight transfer (CWT) proposed by chang2018distributed
addresses the data scarecity at individual sites but is not privacy
preserving.

<p>
AUROC for classification tasks on the two datasets is provided,
performance is compared for the following: 1. centralized, 2.
centralized with differential privacy, 3. distributed with cyclic
weight transfer and 4. distributed with cyclic weight transfer
under differential privacy.
</p>

<p>
In general, the performance of 4. is slightly lower than 3. which is
similar but not equal to 1. 3. performs better than 2. The
performance increases with increase in participants.
</p></dd>
<dt>limitations</dt><dd><p>
Authors identify that their testing distribution is
unrealistic. To address, they propose a hybrid training procedure
where a global model and a local model are trained. The local model
can be used to capture local trends and biases.
</p>

<p>
Authors wish to improve the system such that it can handle sites
with small amount of data which makes it difficult to extract
meaningful information.
</p></dd>
<dt>remarks</dt><dd><p>
The paper addresses the limitations of centralized
datasets and federated learning uses differential privacy with
cyclical weight transfer.
</p>

<p>
No runtime analysis is done even though the paper claims that the
communication costs compared to FL are significantly reduced (the
parameter server is no longer required). Other evaluation metrics
not mentioned, data distribution unknown so we do not know how well
the AUROC metric represents the model.
</p>

<p>
Authors should have compared their results with that of
shokri2015privacy to see how cyclic weight transfer is different
from DP in parallel.
</p>

<p>
Authors only tested the system upto 5 participants, it would be good
to see the max participants required to reach top performance. Also
good to identify max participants after which the performance does
not improve.
</p>

<p>
Authors used 5 participants with the largest data, which does not
reflect the skewed distribution in real world.
</p>

<p>
The future work proposed does not make sense to me. How do they
integrate the local model to improve the performance of the global?
Isnt the whole point of FL to address the bias in local datasets but
utilizing shared parameters?

<dt>problem statement</dt><dd><p>
medical images are large and sensitive in
nature, the paper proposes a new privacy and performance focused
solution for DL with medical data. Medical data is protected and
cannot be aggregated in central location. Institutes are forced to
use local data to train which leads to overfitting since the
datasets are skewed.
</p>

<p>
There is a communication and computation overhead with FL. In FL,
the models communicate twice in each training cycle: once to
download original model and again to download the aggregated
weights. The computation cost comes from the fact that several
models need to be trained simultaneously. Also, as the model becomes
deeper, these costs add up so the methodology does not scale too
well.
</p></dd>
<dt>solution</dt><dd>proposed solution is to reduce communication bandwidth
and maintaining computation efficiency. The system contains multiple
participants and a central server. The participants train their
models using local data. The participants only have the first layer
(L1) of the model, the rest are on the central server. Participants
communicate the output of L1 to the server where the rest of the
model is trained using each participant's weights. The output of the
final layer is transmitted back to all participants where the
gradient is calculated. The gradients are sent to the server for
backprop. The gradient of L2 sent to all participants to finally
calculate the loss.</dd>
<dt>results</dt><dd>The communication overhead is analysed for image
classification using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Two models ResNeT and
VGG are used. The models are trained using the poposed method and
Large Scale Stocastic Gradient Descent. The communication cost of
the new system is noted to be significantly lower while achieving
significantly higher accuracy compared to SGD.</dd>
<dt>limitations</dt><dd>Authors mention no limitations. They only propose
that in the future the system is expected to be implemented in
geo-distributed clinics.</dd>
<dt>remarks</dt><dd>Not clear if gradient is aggregated before backprop or if
each gradient is backproped through the network. Unclear if the
models are trained for multiple epochs or just once? The amount of
data communicated varies with the model, we should conduct analysis
using U-Net. The communication costs are not compared to that of FL
where the participants communicate only twice. Is the quantity of
data communicated lower? More analysis needed. Medical data was not
used, data distribution not reported. Did not compare classification
results to centralized training so we do not know how accuracy of
model is affected by the new distributed protocol. The server can
still be breached but since L1 is not present, model inversion
attacks can be prevented? Can attacker breach participants and

There is a trade-off between HE and Fully Homomorphic Encryption

This also makes the communication between participant-server secure.
The model is not evaluated in a distributed manner, need analysis of
runtime and performance when applied to FL. Since data is encrypted,

Adversarial networks applied to privacy preserving learning for
image segmentation.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Problem statement</dt><dd><p>
Privacy laws on medical data impedes the
development of centralized, cloud based image analysis systems.
This has the benefit of not requiring any specialized hardware
on-site, immediate troubleshooting and easy software and
hardware updates.
</p>

<p>
Centralized systems require a client-server mode of
communication. The communication can be encrypted to prevent
outside attacks but this cannot prevent cybercriminals to
exploit the data once they have gained access to the system.
</p>

<p>
Patient data can be anonymized by removing the patient's
metadata from the DICOM data (done by converting to data format
which do not support metadata eg. PNG). However, the identify of
the patient can be reconstructed using the contents of the image
with up to 97% accuracy.
</p>

<p>
Federated Learning (FL) is another approach where the training
gradients of the data is transferred to a centralized service
rather than the data itself. This allows for training models
locally on geographically separate sites. However, this
centralized model cannot make predictions on test set without
transmitting patient data.
</p>

<p>
Next is Homomorphic Encryption (HE) which facilitates training
on encrypted and decrypted data. However it only supports linear
operations (addition and multiplication) thus for CNNs which use
non-linear operations, the runtime performance is suboptimal
with added communication overhead.
</p></dd>

<dt>Solution</dt><dd><p>
Paper proposes a distributed, client-server
platform. The input from the clients is passed through an
Encoder to obfuscate into a signal containing enough semantic
information for analysis. This signal is sent to the server for
analysis and the results are sent back to the client.
</p>

<p>
Work is inspired by GANs (generative adversarial networks)
consisting of three components: 1. an image encoder 2. a
discriminator and 3. a medical image analysis network (CNN for
segmentation in this case).
</p>

<p>
Paper claims to present the first client-server system for
semantic medical image segmentation with identify preserving
distributed learning. 
</p></dd>

<dt>Results</dt><dd><p>
Paper reports the datasets and performance of models.
Experiments conducted on two independent datasets indicate that
the model is able to maintain performance on the target task
while preserving the patient's privacy.
</p>

<p>
Using the obfuscating techniques presented in the paper along
with existing anonymizing techniques may allow exchange of
sensitive data across medical institutes. This can aid in
heterogeneous clinical studies.
</p>

<p>
The proposed method is also able to generalize to encoded images
not seen during training, something that existing work fail to
do.

<dt>Limitations</dt><dd>Both datasets used for evaluation contained MRI
images of adult brains. Future work will test the generalization

<dt>solution</dt><dd><p>
NiftyNet is a deep learning platform to facilitate
common medical tasks using deep learning. The platform consists of
common infrastructure (such as data loading, data augmentation, loss
functions and evaluation metrics) and networks used in medical
imaging. It also contains a database of pre-trained models for
specific tasks in the field.

<p>
Allows researchers to generate DL models for segmentation,
regression, image generation and representation learning
applications.
</p></dd>
<dt>results</dt><dd>results for two task - abdominal organ segmentation and
image regression are presented. I am not sure what else to note down
here.</dd>
<dt>limitations</dt><dd>The platform is yet to support image classification,
registration, enhancement and pathology detection. The platform
supports a small number of models as proof-of-concept which does not
contain state-of-the-art models. NiftyNet relies on users to provide
the data, data partitioning and model selection. Plans have been
made to support built-in cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning
in the future.</dd>

Paper presents encryption schemes for privacy preservation of medical
data in a centralized architecture. I do not have anything on this so
far, might be worthwhile to add it.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Problem statement</dt><dd>Research in genomic studies generate big data.
With the popularization of cloud computing, this big data is being
stored in the cloud for analysis. However data is protected by
privacy laws thus it must be protected. Schemes to protect the
privacy have been proposed but they are lacking as they assume weak
attackers who do not collude amongst each other.</dd>

<dt>Solution</dt><dd><p>
Paper proposes a new scheme to preserve patient privacy.
The proposed scheme first adds noise to the data followed by
encryption making it safe to transfer to Cloud Storage Providers
(CSP). The CSP is required to communicate with a mediator and a
genome repository manager (GRM) which facilitates de-noising,
masking and re-encryption.
</p>

<p>
Leakage at GRM does not compromise the privacy since data contains
noise and is encrypted.

Paper presents an overview of privacy preserving AI techniques used in
the field of medical imaging. It also presents the vulnerabilities of
techniques and attacks that can be made towards them.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Problem statement</dt><dd><p>
Computer vision and ML have predominantly
dominated medical imaging until DL was popularized. Release of large
image datasets (such as ImageNet) has enabled development of models
via transfer learning. These models have been applied to the field
of oncology - tumor detection, genomic characterization, tumor
subtyping, grading prediction outcome risk assessment. Also
non-oncologic applications - chest X-ray analysis and retinal fundus
imaging.
</p>

<p>
Medical data is hard to come by. Data from a single institute does
not represent the general corpus of data - thus introducing a
significant bias in the models. It is clear that the data across
institutes need to be used. There is a lack of standardized patient
data collection methodology and management of said data can be
expensive.
</p>

<p>
Data format in the Medical Imaging domain is standardized to the
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medine (DICOM) format. Older
medical data (stored on films) can be digitized. Advancements in
storage capacity of machines and the cloud have enabled this data to
be easily shared.
</p>

<p>
Second problem is the strict laws and regulations protecting patient
records. United States Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) mandate strict rules on storage and sharing of
medical data.

Paper presents a tool to alter the images to preserve privacy,
interesting and different approach so far. Cannot be included in the
study but presents a method which does not require deep learning.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Problem statement</dt><dd><p>
There is a need for sharing medical images for
research. The privacy of the patient needs to be preserved, usually
the norm is to remove all patient metadata from the image from
sharing. There is no set standard for de-identification of medical
images, different policies proposing different requirements. In
general, there are 3 approaches - 1. de-identification (removal of
patient identifiers) 2. pseudonymization (de-identification and
replacement of identifiers with pseudonym unique to the patients but
cannot be linked back to them in the real world) and 3.
anonymization (de-identification and further removal of info to
reduce probability of re-identification).
</p>

<p>
DICOM already provides means of de-identification. The problem
however is that there needs to be means of re-identification of the
image such that after analysis of the image, the results may be
shared with the patients. To do so, some fields of the DICOM need to
remain intact or unique to the patient.
</p></dd>

<dt>Solution</dt><dd>Paper proposes a method for de-identification and
re-identification of medical images. Certain metadata required for
re-identification are encrypted and stored on the image itself.
After analysis, the fields can be decrypted using a key.</dd>

<dt>Results</dt><dd>Paper presents DcmEnc, an extension to the DCMTK tool
set.

Paper presents algorithm to anonymize medical data.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Problem statement</dt><dd><p>
Rise in the usage and sharing of Electronic
Health Data (EHD) has been observed in recent years and expected
to rise in next 10 years. This data is utilized for research to
aid in faster development of remedies and analytical tasks such
as data mining, classification, clustering, etc.
</p>

<p>
Sharing EHD is important, however the publicized data must keep
the patient's information anonymized. Several solutions have
been proposed each with drawbacks (the author claims this but
does not provide any references). Fun example: Governor of
Massachusetts was identified by combining voter registration
lists and medical datasets.
</p>

<p>
There is a trade-off between privacy of patient and utility of
the data. The data can be anonymized by adding random noise to
the dataset but this reduces the quality of analysis which can
be conducted with the dataset.
</p></dd>

<dt>Solution</dt><dd>Paper proposes a new data privacy policy loosely
based on Differential Privacy which retains privacy without
compromising the utility of the data.</dd>
