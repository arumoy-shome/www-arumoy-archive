I attended the [ICAI](https://icai.ai/) session on *Ethics & AI*. It
was a really informative session which touched upon some very
interesting and intriguing topics. In this article, I share some of my
thoughts on the matter.

1. We know that if we use an AI system and then utilize its output as
   input to retrain the model, we may end up with a "self-fulfilling
   prophecy" situation. But what can we do to prevent this? I think
   this comes back to the data where we must put checks in place to
   prevent retraining with data that was directly generated by the AI
   system. But how do we do this?
2. AI has been used to solve problems in healthcare, produce self
   driving cars and predict risk to society for convicts. But these
   systems suffer from serious problems of bias. This begs the
   question: "Are there certain problems where we should *not* be
   using AI"? If we put an engineering lens on how AI systems work, we
   can consider it to be a smart automation system. And then we can
   perhaps begin to see that not all tasks are worth automating.
3. Self driving cars may work in the roads of certain parts of North
   America. There is bright light, roads are wide, and traffic
   consists mostly of cars and trucks. But it will (and we have
   evidence that) fail to operate in say the streets of
   Amsterdam. This is a known problem of AI (think [Andrew's
   example](https://youtu.be/06-AZXmwHjo) of fault detection on
   factory floors). This means that we not only have to consider the
   car but also the environment in which it operates. This lead me to
   think: What if we monitor the internal rather than its external
   environment of a car?" The internals of a car are much more uniform
   which may be easier to monitor and thus produce less "noise" and
   edge cases for the autonomous driving system to learn from.
4. On the notion of "What is ethics"? I think that culture plays an
   important role. Take the example of the [Indian child what was
   taken away from his
   parents](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nightmare-in-norway-indian-couple-fights-to-get-children-back-568348)
   because a neighbour saw him sleeping in his parent's bedroom. This
   was in a "western" country where children sleep in their own room
   (or in a crib) from a very early age. However in India, children
   sleep with their parents until they are quite old.
5. All the ethics questions raised against AI systems makes me wonder
   how engineering can help solve this problem. In engineering,
   "divide and conquer" a highly adopted principle. I wonder if we are
   trying to do too much with a single AI system. Perhaps we can break
   the problem of monitoring a patient's health into several
   sub-problems and solve them individually with smaller AI
   systems. This also helps with the explainability of the AI systems
   since they are very focused on a single task. The results from
   these sub-systems then can be aggregated to answer a larger
   problem.
