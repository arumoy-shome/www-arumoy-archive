student, we learn about fundamentals of engineering such as physics,
chemistry, materials, adv. mathematics, etc. Emphasis is put on the
design of the engineering solution by learning how to understand and
disect the problem and the users. This enables us to address problems
with multiple facets such as environment, society, law, politics and
more.

I have wanted to work at CWI ever since I became aware of the
institution (2018) and of the many successful and influential
scientists who have worked there. Many successful projects/companies
started at CWI, Python - the programming language - being one of them.
</p>

<p>
CWI is a national research institute for computer science and
mathematics here in the Netherlands and well reputed both domestically
and internationally.
</p>

<p>
Besides Python, CWI was also the birthplace of the European Internet,
first '.nl' internet domain and the first Dutch computer. Their
research is rooted in practical, real world problems which is
something I relate to as well.

<dt>3D kadaster</dt><dd>The goal of the project was to develop a 3D model of

complexity.</dd>
<dt>Omniart</dt><dd>The goal of the project was to create an interactive

<h2 id="org83d17ff">Problem statement</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org83d17ff">
<p>
XR generates more data than traditional media. This makes it difficult
to transmit in its entirety due to limitations posed by the network
bandwidth. Thus the first challenge is to perform signal processing in
order to determine important aspects of the data. The second challenge
is to optimise the QoE within the constrains posed by the network
leading to advancements in adaptive streaming and compression
techniques.

<p>
<i>This might be a bit too long, just mention location and date of Bsc.,
work experience of 2 years, Msc. location and date and Omniart.</i>
</p>


<p>
I received my Bsc. in SYDE with a minor in entrepreneurship from the
University of Waterloo, Canada. I concluded my degree with a 8 month,
research project. As part of this project, my team and I created
Elevate: A cost effective and improved cognitive assessment tool for
individuals with Down syndrome.
</p>

<p>
I started to develop an interest for programming and through the co-op
program I was able to develop this interest by working as an intern at
several small and large scale companies. One of these companies,
Shopify (one of the largest e-commerce companies in N. America) where
I spent a year working as a software engineer on the product side (was
able to further develop my design skills - constant interaction with
clients, designers, engineers and product managers). Being surrounded
by entrepreneurial minds got me interested in the business side of
things: decided to persue the Entrepreneurship option (minor). I also
realised the importance of data and how Shopify (like many other
companies) were using their data to drive the value of their product.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to bring my entrepreneurial, software and design skills to
large scale problems: decided to persue a Msc. in Big Data Engineering
at VU and UvA. During this time I worked on several data driven
projects. 1. was to develop a 3D model of all buildings in the
Netherlands using pointcloud data and 2. was to develop an interface
to visualize sentiments of artistic paintings - which got published in
ACM MM 2019.
</p>

<p>
Through the Msc. program I started developing an interest in research,
and innovating with bleeding edge tools and techniques. This was also
the time I became familiar with AI and recognized its value. To
develop my knowledge I got an internship at the eScience center. Here
I worked with UvA, eScience and Nikhef to develop a data processing
pipeline for the KM3Net neutrino telescope - which was also my Msc.
thesis. Although I needed 3 extra months to finish the project due to
the pandemic, I think it was a success. My work is amongst a handful
which explores application of NNs for Particle Physics within the
KM3NeT group. My thesis is one of the first to explore the
applications of graph neural networks in Particle Physics.
</p>

<p>
Which brings us to Today.

<div id="outline-container-org405112f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org405112f">Why do I want to persue a PhD?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org405112f">
<p>
Working with AI during my Msc. surfaced some of the challenges and
limitations in the field, a major one being the lack of trust in the
predictions of AI systems. What I realised was that this problem
exists because AI systems are built without consideration of the end
user. So I want to explore this problem space and combine my
background in design and AI to find a solution to this problem.
</p>

<p>
The other part is due to selfish reasons. I have always had the urge
to continually learn new things by putting myself in unknown and
uncomfortable positions. I want to improve my existing knowlege, gain
expertise in this field so that I can have an impact on society, bring
value to others lives and contribute to the scientific community in a
meaningful way. I think that a PhD will allow me to do just that.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2bb6d58" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2bb6d58">If asked why there is a lack of trust</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2bb6d58">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the "black box" nature (we know how the internals work but we do
not know why acertain number of neurons, number of layers, choice
of activation function works for a given dataset)</li>
<li>lack of generalizability (we have to keep training network with new
data, risks of catastrophic forgetting)</li>
<li>lack of ability to apply knowledge (NN train with bodyparts of
human anatomy cannot identify body parts of other animals).</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-orgfceb25b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfceb25b">Why did I choose this PhD position?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfceb25b">
<p>
I think this project has the potential of having a meaningful impact
on society because XR will revolutionise how we communicate with one
another which is such a fundamental aspect of life.
</p>

<p>
I also have a personal interest. I am an ameture musician and
passionate about music. And so I am concerned about negative impact
the pandemic is having on the music industry because touring and live
concerts is a major revenue stream for the industry. And I think that
XR can be a potential solution to this problem which can allow us to
hold virtual concerts.
</p>

<p>
I think it has profound implications in healthcare and education as
well. Besides allowing doctors to provide virtual consultations (which
I know you are already working on), it can aid them in performing
remote operations with a realistic and accurate representation of the
patient's injuries.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, I think XR will have a social impact as well. Going back to
Elevate, one of the key challenges we faced while conducting user
testing was that the children did not feel comfortable in our offices
because it was a new environment for them. I think XR can help
alliviate these challenges. Going back to the virtual consultation
example, a patient with cognitive/psychological challenges can
function as part of society because they can consult a doctor from the
comfort of their home.

<p>
Conclude with a summary of <a href="#orga5bbb53">why do I want to work at CWI?</a>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Extra:</i> It can also allow us to build extremely interactive cognitive
tests (tie this to Elevate) with the posibility of tracking eye and
limb movements.

<h3 id="orga5bbb53">Why do I want to work at CWI?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga5bbb53">
<p>
I became aware of CWI through Peter Bonz in 2018, during his Large
Scale Data Engineering course. He talked about the interesting
projects being worked on at CWI and that was really interesting to me:
I saw CWI as one of my potential future employers. In 2019 I attended
a talk at CWI about Python. Not only was it interesting to hear
Guido's experience working at CWI while developing the language. It
was also fascinating to hear accounts from his colleagues and
supervisors and all the prior work they did.

I strongly believe in the saying that "You are the average of the
people you surround yourself with". I believe that CWI can provide the
connections and environment for me to grow professionally and I would

<h3 id="org9639420">Why am I a good fit?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9639420">
<p>
I think what sets me apart from other candidates is that I have formal
training in designing and developing human-centric systems which do
not neglect the end user's experience and I think this will vital to
this project. Besides this, I also have extensive knowledge and
experience working with AI and I think that the group and this project
can benefit from this. I also have professional software engineering
experience so I am well versed with managing technical projects and
familiar with the tools that will allow me to be productive in the
group quickly. Lastly, good communication and writing skills are
crutial for any research project I think this is amply demonstrated by
my past experience and projects.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdbcea00">
<p>
My unique background in design, engineering, big data and AI will be
an asset to the project and the team. I believe that my prior
experience working with pointclouds, user-centric design and signal
processing will allow me to onboard into the team quickly.
</p>

<p>
Working with hardware will be new for me and getting used to operating
them, obtaining the data and working with the data can be a challenge
initially. Besides this, my knowledge of networks, transmission of
multimedia and computer graphics is limited and I will need some time
to familiarlise myself with them.

<p>
I have noticed is that I often find it difficult to balance between
exploration and exploitation. This is a double edged sword because it
can be benefitial to be a bit more detail oriented and experiment more
in order to find a better/optimal solution but at some point we have
to draw the line and start focusing on communicating our discoveries
which is in my opinion the more challenging aspect of research.
</p>

<p>
I think the only way to improve is through deliberate practise. I have
gotten better since my first projects and I think I will progressively
get better with each project I work on.

contributions to the scientific community along the way.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org22dd31a">
<p>
<i>TODO</i> read more papers to identify potential challenges
</p>

<p>
The main challenge will be to optimize the user's experience within
the constrains posed by their network. This will be challenging
because the network bandwidth is dynamic so our solution must scale
accordingly. My knowledge of networks is limited but I do know that
programmable networks have become the norm recently so we can look
into that for a potential solution.
</p>

<p>
I know that the group is doing work in trying to quantify QoE. I
expect some challenges there because it is such a difficult task as
experience very subjective. I am intrigued as to how we can quantify
it.
</p>

<p>
XR generates a lot more data than its predecessors. To transmit the
data in its entirety becomes infeasible so it is important to
prioritise what to transmit and remove as much noise as possible. To
perform signal processing of pointclouds and to do this in real time
can pose a technical and computational challenge (be aware of the
hardware available to user).

<h3 id="orge234bc2">A challenge I encountered, overcame and lessons learned</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge234bc2">
<p>
One challenge I encountered while working on my Thesis was properly
evaluating my models. The dataset I was working with was highly skewed
(more examples of negative class compared to positive class). However
the sheer size of the dataset amplified the problem to an extent that
the recommended metrics for dealing with skewed data also failed to
evaluate the model correctly.
</p>

<p>
The solution was to dig a bit deeper and fall back to a primitive
evaluation metric which is the confusion matrix. This allowed me to
identify the root cause of the problem.
</p>

<p>
It can be easy to fall into a automated workflow once we acheive a
feedback loop. However, sometimes it is necessary to take a step back
and evaluate the feedback loop itself since it can contain pitfalls as
well.

I really enjoy working as a researcher and innovating with bleeding

entrepreneurial avenues and I think this PhD will highlight

<p>
I think I will need to take some courses on the networks and computer
graphics side of things. I do not have any experience working with
image and video. I will also need to spend some time refamiliarising
myself with pointnets since its been a while. I recall that generating
the 3D mesh from pointclouds was particularly difficult, so I might
have to spend some time on that as well.
