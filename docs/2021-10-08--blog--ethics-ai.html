<h1 class="title">Ethics &amp; AI</h1>

<p>I attended the <a href="https://icai.ai/">ICAI</a> session on
<em>Ethics &amp; AI</em>. It was a really informative session which
touched upon some very interesting and intriguing topics. In this
article, I share some of my thoughts on the matter.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We know that if we use an AI system and then utilize its output as
input to retrain the model, we may end up with a “self-fulfilling
prophecy” situation. But what can we do to prevent this? I think this
comes back to the data where we must put checks in place to prevent
retraining with data that was directly generated by the AI system. But
how do we do this?</li>
<li>AI has been used to solve problems in healthcare, produce self
driving cars and predict risk to society for convicts. But these systems
suffer from serious problems of bias. This begs the question: “Are there
certain problems where we should <em>not</em> be using AI”? If we put an
engineering lens on how AI systems work, we can consider it to be a
smart automation system. And then we can perhaps begin to see that not
all tasks are worth automating.</li>
<li>Self driving cars may work in the roads of certain parts of North
America. There is bright light, roads are wide, and traffic consists
mostly of cars and trucks. But it will (and we have evidence that) fail
to operate in say the streets of Amsterdam. This is a known problem of
AI (think <a href="https://youtu.be/06-AZXmwHjo">Andrew’s example</a> of
fault detection on factory floors). This means that we not only have to
consider the car but also the environment in which it operates. This
lead me to think: What if we monitor the internal rather than its
external environment of a car?” The internals of a car are much more
uniform which may be easier to monitor and thus produce less “noise” and
edge cases for the autonomous driving system to learn from.</li>
<li>On the notion of “What is ethics”? I think that culture plays an
important role. Take the example of the <a
href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nightmare-in-norway-indian-couple-fights-to-get-children-back-568348">Indian
child what was taken away from his parents</a> because a neighbour saw
him sleeping in his parent’s bedroom. This was in a “western” country
where children sleep in their own room (or in a crib) from a very early
age. However in India, children sleep with their parents until they are
quite old.</li>
<li>All the ethics questions raised against AI systems makes me wonder
how engineering can help solve this problem. In engineering, “divide and
conquer” a highly adopted principle. I wonder if we are trying to do too
much with a single AI system. Perhaps we can break the problem of
monitoring a patient’s health into several sub-problems and solve them
individually with smaller AI systems. This also helps with the
explainability of the AI systems since they are very focused on a single
task. The results from these sub-systems then can be aggregated to
answer a larger problem.</li>
