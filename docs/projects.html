<p>Following is a list of projects I am currently working on, or have
worked on in the past. Where possible, I have included links to the
Github repository, published/unpublished papers and the project
website.</p>
<p>The project website can be consulted to get a broad overview of the
project whilst the papers can be read if one wishes for more depth on
the matter. I usually host my projects on Github, the README can be
consulted to get familiar with the structure of the repository.</p>

<h1 id="km3net">[2020] KM3NeT</h1>
<p><em>Python, Pytorch, Pytorch Geometric</em></p>
<p>Neutrinos are highly elusive subatomic particles which can only be
detected with the help of large particle detectors. The KM3NeT neutrino
telescope is one such detector currently being constructed at the bottom
on the Mediterranean Sea. Due to its large volume and the presence of
background noise, <code>event trigger</code> algorithms are utilized by
the data acquisition pipeline of the detector to sift through the noise.
A GPU Pipeline was also developed to improve the quality of filtration
of the event trigger algorithms without compromising their runtime
performance. Despite these efforts, the quality of filtration require
further improvements. The goal of this paper is to improve upon the GPU
Pipeline using Artificial Neural Networks. The paper explores the
possibility of replacing parts of the GPU Pipeline using Multi Layer
Perceptrons and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. The Multi Layer
Perception performs better compared to the existing solution while the
results of the Graph Convolutional Network are inconclusive in its
existing form. Overall, the outcome is promising and new avenues of
research are discovered through this work.</p>

Privacy Preserving Deep Learning for Medical Imaging</h1>
<p><em>Latex</em></p>
<p>The success of Deep Neural Networks with image classification
prompted researchers to explore the applications of Deep Learning in
Medical Imaging and Medical Image Analysis (MIA). Deep Neural Networks
have sufficiently demonstrated their capabilities of performing MIA
tasks tirelessly and with fewer errors as opposed to their human
counterpart. However the challenge of training neural networks using
sensitive medical data, without violating the privacy of patients
remains an active field of research. Many solutions exist to address
this concern, however a systematic review and analysis of these
techniques is yet to be conducted. This paper attempts to conduct the
first systematic review of privacy-preserving techniques to train deep
learning models. Emphasis is especially put on the performance and
privacy analysis of the techniques. In addition, the communication and
runtime costs, the ability of the solutions to scale, tolerance to
faults and the level of security against threats and attacks are also
studied.</p>

<p><em>JavaScript, Phaser.io</em></p>
<p>Specialized educational resources for individuals with Down Syndrome
are lacking. This problem space was explored in detail through surveys
and interviews with both the primary and secondary users. Several
problems were discovered in this space of which, the lack of an
affordable, easy to use and engaging cognitive test was deemed critical.
This problem was further explored and an improved form of this
assessment using web based games was proposed. The design process was
broken down into three iterative phases. The first was defining the
problem, followed by validating the solutions and finally iterating on
the final solution. Throughout the phases, five main approaches were
used to help with the analysis and iterative process. The approaches
included user surveys, user Interviews, Wizard of Oz testing, usability
testing, and user testing. Engagement, key usability issues and scoring
correlation with standard methods were the primary testing protocols
used for validation of the final designed solution. The results and
limitations of the designed solution are touched upon and a few
reasonable next steps are laid upon for the future.</p>
