<h1 class="title">Research Workflow</h1>
<p class="author">Arumoy Shome</p>
<p class="date">2021-06-03 Thu 17:25</p>
</header>
<p>Here I outline a workflow which I have developed to handle the
non-linear nature of scientific research. There are days when one reads
several papers without making much sense of them. However, a single
paper the next day can result in a clear picture of the domain. The
workflow acknowledges the fact that there are many more failures rather
than successes in research. However, a failure is still an outcome—and
this is what helps us decide what to do next—so it should still be
recorded.</p>
<p>Research workflows are highly personal. If you decide to adopt any or
all ideas I present here, it may require some tweaking so that it works
for you. Years of performing an extrinsic search for existing solutions
was unfruitful. Instead, I simply started reading papers and let the
process develop organically. Soon I noticed some common patterns and
standardisation which allowed me to automate some aspects of the
process.</p>
<p>There are 3 interdependent phases to this process described
below.</p>
<h1 id="finding-papers">Finding papers</h1>
<p>I save the bibtex entry in a bib file (generally in the project root
along with the other latex files). This is because the bibtex-mode in
Emacs provides powerful search options, templates for adding entries,
sorting entries, cleaning up, and much more. Besides, the bib files
ultimately gets used in the report so it makes sense to group the two
together and keep them in the same location.</p>
<ul>
<li>UPDATE [2021-06-15 Tue]: I no longer save bibtex entry in a bib
file. Instead, I store them with my notes in the same org file in source
code blocks. I use org-tangle to generate the bib file when needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, I use good ol’ Google Scholar (along with a plugin to enable
my institution’s proxy) to find papers. Once, I find a paper I open it
and read the abstract. If the abstract appeals to my current research
focus or is interesting to me in general, I download it and save it in a
folder which syncs across my devices. Next, I grab the bibtex entry and
create a task using org-capture where I save the bibtex entry, one liner
on why I found the paper interesting. I add the location to the pdf on
disk, I set the title of the task as the bibtex entry and I save it to
my <em>inbox</em> (or relevant project org file).</p>
<ul>
<li>UPDATE [2021-06-15 Tue]: I have written an Elisp package that
automates all of this. With the bibtex entry in my clipboard, I now
issue an org-capture template which creates a new task with the bibkey
as the header, adds relevant properties such as <em>first author</em>
<em>last author</em> and <em>source</em> of publication, and sticks the
bibtex entry in a source block (see <a
href="https://github.com/arumoy-shome/aocp.el">aocp.el</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="2021-06-09--blog--scientific-paper-discovery">scientific
paper discovery</a> I describe my process of finding relevant papers in
more detail.</p>
<h1 id="reading-papers">Reading papers</h1>
<p>I read the papers on my laptop. My screen is usually split 50-50
between Emacs (where I take notes) and a pdf viewer. I do not make any
highlights because its easy to abuse and it ties the information to the
pdf viewer application that I am using.</p>
<p>Instead, I take notes in plain text (as of [2020], I have been using
org-mode, an Emacs major mode to do so). There are several, rationales
for doing this digitally. First, I require these notes to be searchable
and link-able to other notes. Second, research projects often span for a
long duration. Having digital notes ensures that I do not have notes
distributed amongst several analog papers/journals. Lastly, I take notes
on papers in a specific manner. These notes have a specific purpose -
and thus a carefully constructed structure as described in the next
section - and thus come under the category of <em>hard</em> information
(I talk more about productivity and how I categorise information in <a
href="LINKME">productivity</a>).</p>
<p>I use the 3 pass technique as presented by S. Keshav in his paper
titled “How to read a paper” (2007). I employ the first pass as a
screening method to identify if a given paper is worth reading in full.
During the first pass, I read the introduction and conclusion and
briefly glance over the sections of the paper and the diagrams. The goal
here is to determine the problem that the paper is trying to solve and
get a preliminary idea of the proposed solution and results. Generally,
I can determine all the above characteristics just by the reading the
introduction and conclusion if the paper is well written.</p>
<p>During the second pass, I read the results, discussion and limitation
sections in full. During this phase I {edit, elaborate} my earlier notes
made during first pass and also add my personal remarks pertaining to
the paper. When reading scientific work in detail, it is often helpful
to read at a macro and micro level. For instance, before reading a
section from top to bottom - in a linear sense - I often find it helpful
to first scan the sub-sections and draw a tree diagram of the topics.
This allows me to have a visual representation of the section which
often times is enough to quickly conduct a mental cost-benefit analysis
of reading the section in detail.</p>
<p>I rarely read a paper in it’s entirety. I think this is essential
when you peer-review a paper (which I do not do yet as of [2021-06-30
Wed]) but unnecessary for day-to-day scientific work.</p>
<h1 id="writing-notes">Writing notes</h1>
<p>Notes on paper being read will always be in relation to the current
research focus/goal. A paper may be read multiple times but will have
different notes if they were made with reference to different research
questions.</p>
<p>Following this rationale, I store the notes in an org file pertaining
to the project I am working on. I store the pdfs in a central location,
synced with a cloud service provider so as to have offline access.</p>
<p>And following are the aspects that I look out for when reading
papers.</p>
<pre><code>+ problem statement :: What is the problem the paper is trying to
  solve? Why is this problem important? Why should I care? This
  generally leads to a good material for the introduction of my
  paper as well.
+ solution :: What is the solution the paper proposes? How is it
  better compared to existing ones (do the authors try to show its
  worth by comparing to existing solutions)? Why should I care about
  it?
+ results :: What were the analytical experiments conducted and what
  were their results? What datasets were used? What models were used
  and how did they perform? How was their performance evaluated?

  Generally, in my field these questions can be answered by reading
  the results section, very rarely are results disclosed in the
  conclusion section. Note that falls out of the &#39;first pass&#39; content
  so I may come back to this only if I need this information for the
  task at hand.
+ limitations :: Does the paper identify its limitations? what
  future work can be done?
+ remarks :: My personal remarks on the paper. Was it well written? Is
  it scientifically sound? Does it present a good overview of the
  problem it is trying to solve? This critical examination and
  cross-checking is essential when conducting a literature review.</code></pre>
<p>After writing down notes on the topics above, I try to write a one
line summary of the paper along with my remarks. These are always guided
by the research question or work at hand.</p>
<p>The <em>“why should I care?”</em> flavor questions will generally be
guided by the research question or personal interest that I may have at
the time of reading.</p>
<p>It’s worth elaborating on the writing process itself because this in
itself is a highly non-linear and dynamic activity. With regards to my
personal writing, I have noticed that the quantity and quality of notes
are inversely proportional. In the early stages of a project, or when I
am trying to familiarise myself with a new research topic, I tend to
write more notes which are primitive (meaning they emphasise on the
first principles) and are similar to the papers I am reading at that
point in time. However, with exposure to more papers, the notes become
more concise and opinionated (they reflect my thoughts and ideas on the
matter).</p>
<p>I also employ writing on paper and typing in an iterative, cyclic
manner to formulate concise and clear text which express my discoveries,
ideas and opinions.</p>
