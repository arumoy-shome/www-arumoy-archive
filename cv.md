# Education

## [2021-2025] PhD. Software Engineering for AI

*Technische Universiteit Delft, Delft, The Netherlands*

## [2018-2020] Msc. Computer Science, Big Data Engineering

*Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam & Universiteit van Amsterdam,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands*

## [2012-2018] Bsc. Honours System Design Engineering, Entrepreneurship Option

*University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada*

# Publications

## [2019] ACE: Art, Color and Emotions

*ACM International Conference*

+ Created a data driven platform for exploring visual sentiment and
  emotion in artistic paintings over time.
+ Trained a custom visual artistic sentiment extraction model using
  the OmniArt dataset.
+ The platform is web based and built using D3.js and Javascript.
+ The paper can be accessed via the [ACM Digital
  Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3343031.3350588) and a short
  demo of the application can be found on
  [Youtube](https://youtu.be/B1ZM6EQgEvU).

# Public Projects

## [2018] 3D Kadaster

+ Developed a 3D model of all buildings in The Netherlands using AHN2
  point cloud dataset and BAG building polygons dataset.
+ Processed data using Apache Spark, ran algorithms on SurfSara's
  Hathi cluster and created visualisations using Three.js.
+ Detailed information on the research question, datasets and
  methodology can be found in the [paper](assets/pdf/kadaster.pdf) and
  the visualisation can be viewed on the [project
  website](https://arumoy.me/3d-kadaster/).
+ The project received recognition and was added to the course
  instructor's [Hall of
  Fame](https://event.cwi.nl/lsde/2018/showcase\_c1.shtml).

## [2018] Knowledge Acquisition from CommonCrawl

+ Applied a complete knowledge acquisition pipeline to WARC datasets
  using natural language processing, part of speech tagging, named
  entity recognition and entity linking.
+ The algorithms were run in parallel using Apache Spark on the [DAS4
  cluster](https://www.cs.vu.nl/das4/).
+ Proposed a novel idea to improve entity retrieval using machine
  learning, details for which can be found in the
  [paper](assets/pdf/wdp.pdf).

## [2018] Elevate

+ Collaborated with the Waterloo Regional Down Syndrome Society,
  Canada and Fundacion Paraiso Down, El Salvador.
+ Developed an improved and cheaper alternative to the
  state-of-the-art cognitive assessment tool for individuals with Down
  Syndrome using a Systems approach.
+ Developed a business plan and presented the product at several
  startup incubators and pitch competitions to procure funding.
+ An overview of user research, design methodology and engineering
  solution can be found on the [project
  website](https://arumoy.me/elevate/) with additional details in the
  [paper](assets/pdf/elevate.pdf).

# Work Experience

## [Mar--Sep 2020] Research Intern

*Netherlands eScience Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands*

+ Conducted interdisciplinary research in the field of Computer
  Science, Artificial Intelligence and Particle Physics.
+ Worked in collaboration with researchers from 3 institutes namely
  Universiteit van Amsterdam, Netherlands eScience Center and Nikhef.
+ Conducted signal processing using multi layer perceptrons to
  identify highly elusive neutrino particles.
+ Implemented a novel data processing pipeline for the [KM3NeT
  Neutrino Telescope](https://km3net.org) using state-of-the-art graph
  convolutional networks.
+ The pipeline was implemented using Python and deep learning models
  were developed using PyTorch.
+ Details on the research question, dataset and methodology can be
  found in the [paper](assets/pdf/km3net.pdf). The project is open
  sourced and available on
  [Github](https://github.com/arumoy-shome/km3net).

## [Apr--Jun 2020] Graduate Teaching Assistant

*Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands*

+ Part-time teaching assistant to the Data Mining Techniques graduate
  course at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam presented by [Dr. Mark
  Hoogendorn](https://www.cs.vu.nl/\~mhoogen/).
+ Managed 17 student teams and helped them with practical assignments
  presented in Python.
+ Conducted weekly online tutorial sessions with students and
  clarified doubts regarding course logistics, concepts and theory.
+ Graded 70+ student assignments and provided constructive feedback.
  Managed students performed well in the course with an average grade
  of 8.7.
+ Received highly positive remarks from student evaluation.

## [2015--2016] Web Developer Intern

*Shopify, Ottawa, Canada*

+ Worked as part of a dynamic team of developer, designers and product
  managers to implement numerous features such as web components,
  animations and styling on a mature Ruby on Rails project using Ruby,
  Javascript, HTML & SCSS.
+ Practised object oriented design principles and test driven
  development to refactor code and improve test coverage.
+ Used object relational mapping to lazy load data, reduce database
  calls and minimise server response time thus improving the
  application load time.

## [2014--2015] Intern & Freelance

*Various Employees & Clients, Various Locations, Canada*

+ Worked at several large and small scale companies as part of
  University of Waterloo's Co-op program.
