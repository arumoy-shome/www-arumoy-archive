# Introduction

In this talk I will go over how we can use Emacs and org-mode to craft
a research workflow. We will look at how we can leverage the power of
Emacs and org-mode to capture, store, search and retrieve research
data, all in plain text! The talk will touch upon how org-mode can be
used as an environment for literate programming and reproducible
research. I do not assume any prior knowledge of emacs or org-mode and
I want this to be more of a discussion rather than a talk. Please ask
me questions as I go along and share your thoughts, tips and
techniques with others!

## Outline

Outline of this talk is as follows:

1. I will start with a brief history of Emacs and org-mode.
2. A brief background on plaintext.
3. We will follow with some motivation for why we would want to use
   plaintext to manage information and some of my supporting
   philosophies.
4. Next, we will jump into the building blocks of org-mode.
5. Which we will leverage to craft research workflows and introduce
   some automation into menial tasks.
6. I will highlight some additional features of org-mode that we can
   use for literate programming and reproducible research.
7. I will end this talk by pointing out additional resources that you
   may use to get started with Emacs.

## A Note for the Audience

When I was preparing material for this talk, I thought: what better
way to talk about emacs and org-mode than to do it in emacs itself.
There is a lot of text compared to a traditional presentation, and
there is justification for doing so:

1. This talk is highly interactive and there are demos throughout. It
   would have been a bit annoying having to constantly switch between
   emacs and my slides.
2. There is another reason however I will reveal this towards the end
   of the talk.

# History & Background

When I say text editors, you are most likely are think of software
such as Atom, Sublime Text and VS Code. That's what the normal folks
use to get their job done. However, you may also be aware of this
group of elitists who shun such tools, have a neckbeard, dwell in
dungeons...and use Vim.

## Emacs

Emacs is the **other** text editor that you may have heard of aside from
Vim. There are several flavours of Emacs, the most popular being GNU
Emacs which was created by Richard Stallman. The core, performance
critical components of Emacs is written in C, however majority of it's
codebase is written in emacs-lisp (elisp) which is a variant of Lisp.

The first public release of Emacs was in 1970 (it has 20 years on Vim
which was released in 1991), it is fully open-source, has had 27 stable
releases, has a vibrant and large community and continues to be in
active development to this date.

## org-mode

org-mode is an emacs package. created by Carsten Dominik (professor of
Astronomy at UvA, faculty of natural sciences) in 2003. org-mode
provides two core functionalities:

1.  It provides a major-mode (Emacs lingo for syntax highlighting based
    on filetype) for plaintext files.
2.  And a slew of tools to organize and edit information in the form of
    lists (I like to think of them as trees).

## Plaintext

We have been talking about plaintext and I think it's important to
clarify what I mean. Plaintext in this context means text files which
are unencrypted and written in a format (.{txt,md,org}) that is readable
through a terminal emulator.

## Why use Plaintext?

Why would we want to use plaintext to store information? There are
several benefits, and the word "Freedom" encapsulates everything well.
By freedom, I mean:

1.  Freedom to do what we see fit with our data. Its stored as plaintext
    files on our system. We can choose to keep it that way, upload to
    our trusted cloud provider or even introduce encryption for
    additional security and privacy.
2.  Freedom from yet another proprietary software. There are solutions
    that market themselves as systems for note-taking, knowledge
    management or a "second brain" such as Notion and Evernote. But
    the problem is that they are in control of your data (stored on
    their servers) and they often store this information in a
    proprietary format resulting in a vendor lock-in.
3.  Freedom to choose (or craft) our own tools which are optimised for
    us and can scale with our ever-growing body of knowledge (remember,
    learning is a lifelong journey).

## Plaintext & Productivity

Looking at the current landscape of productivity tools, I do not see
anything that aids in exercising the one true productivity system that
actually matters: our brain. Ultimately, it all comes down to effort and
time taken to read papers, understanding concepts, learning, and forming
connections which give rise to ideas. By takes away the "fluff",
plaintext allows us to focus on the essential. The text. The ideas. The
connections.

There is no "one size fits all" or "cookie cutter" solution when it
comes to productivity. The problem with existing productivity software
is that they enforce their own structure and constraints which does more
harm than good. I have given this a fair amount of thought and
experimentation. In my experience, a two step process of 1. Capturing
information quickly and 2. The act of reviewing captured information and
deliberate summarisation works best. To this end, we will see how
org-mode can help us with this.

## Importance of Structure & Standardisation

I made a profound observation while reflection on my current research
workflow. I spent a lot of my time during my masters on finding tools
and systems for managing knowledge. Extrinsic search for existing
solutions/methods was not fruitful. Instead, I used whatever solution
came naturally to me. Through several iterations and minor changes, I
developed a set of rules to store the data in a consistent structure.
From this structure, developing tools to automate the process developed
organically. I think this is such a simple thing, which makes it so
powerful. We see similar phenomenon in software as well. We have decades
of research which boils down to doing things in a consistent and
standardised manner.

## Non-linear Nature of Research

The main take-away for me was realising that research is dynamic,
non-linear and personal. Finding the right tools is a journey which we
must make ourselves. Using plaintext grants us the freedom to explore
and experiment different options and techniques. It allows us to craft
our own set of tools, standards and techniques which are curated towards
how we think and operate.

# org-mode: First Principles

Text in org documents are stored in an hierarchical manner, in the form
of outlines.

## Document Structure

We can create a new header (or "tree" in org lingo) by prepending the
header title with a `*`. Trees can be nested, a tree may have
several other sub-trees within itself. Sub-trees are created by adding
more `*`, the number indicates the depth. We can promote or
demote headers quickly using the `M-left` and
`M-right` keybindings.

We can hide or show specific sections of a document by pressing
`TAB` while positioning the cursor (or "point" in emacs
lingo) on the header. We can also cycle the visibility of the entire
document using `S-TAB`.

Org provides a few handy keybindings to move between headers.
`C-c n` (mnemonic: "next") takes us to the next header
while `C-c p` (mnemonic: "previous") takes us to the
previous header. `C-c u` (mnemonic: "up") can be used to
navigate to the parent of the current sub-tree. `C-c f`
(mnemonic: "forward") and `C-c b` (mnemonic: "back")
navigates between headers of the same level.

We can edit the structure of a org document quickly by using
`M-down` and `M-up` to move headers.

## Todo States

Org was originally built to manage tasks in plaintext. A header can be
converted to a task by prepending it with a "TODO" keyword. Org also
understands the notion of various stages that a task may go through
during it's lifecycle. We can change the todo state interactively using
`C-c C-t`.

The todo states are customizable and we will talk more about the ones I
have created and use regularly to organize scientific research.

## Capturing & Refiling

**NOTE** this section requires some setup and plumbing before it can be
replicated. Refer to the org manual on
[capture](https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture.html) to get started.

Earlier I mentioned the notion of capturing information and reviewing
them at a later stage as a system for productivity (see the section on
[Motivation & Philosophy](id:6366F488-F260-4E91-A184-20D7983E20B0)).
Let's dive deeper into the capturing segment and explore how org can
help introduce some automation into this process.

We can invoke org-capture using `C-c c` which prompts us for
a capture template. This is customizable and the most commonly used one
is to capture tasks. Once we are satisfied with our content, we can use
`C-c
C-c` (this is also the universal keystroke you would use to
tell emacs that you are "done" with something or to "confirm"
something) to confirm, save and close the capture buffer. Later, I will
also talk about the custom capture template that I have written for my
research workflow.

By default, the captured text is saved in a predefined file, however we
can also choose to save it somewhere else using org-refile (`C-c
C-w` in the org-capture buffer).

# Research Workflows

Let's see how we can leverage what org has to offer in order aid us in
scientific work.

## Planning & Structuring Papers

I find org to be particularly useful for planning and structuring
scientific papers. I also use it to capture my thoughts, ideas and notes
for various projects that I am working on. Once I have accumulated a
large body of text, I find the the "narrow" functionality provided by
emacs to help me focus on a particular section or region of text.

## Bibliography Management

Besides keeping track of tasks, I use org to manage bibliographic
information of scientific publications. Let's look at an example in a
project that I worked on earlier:
[shokri2015privacy](id:6B1B51C5-FEE1-4F53-8623-19215517934A).

Org allows us to assign metadata to org headers known as org-properties.
For instance, I like to store the first author, last author, source of
publication, year of publication and a link to the pdf file on my disk
as properties. Using the `org-sparse-tree` command (bound to
`C-c /` in org-mode buffers), we can quickly find what we are
looking for.

## aocp.el

As you may expect, this task is repetitive and entering these properties
manually becomes cumbersome. To automate this process, I wrote an emacs
package: [aocp.el](https://github.com/arumoy-shome/aocp.el). The package
provides a few helper functions which are meant to be used in an
org-capture template (refer to the project readme for more information).

# Infinity & Beyond

Org let's use schedule tasks and assign deadlines,
[org-agenda](https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html#Agenda-Views)
acts as the front-end and more.

Using [org-export](https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html), we can
export org documents to other formats for simplicity of sharing and
collaboration.

Using [org-publish](https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html), we can
run a website from within emacs.

Org does [tables](https://orgmode.org/manual/Tables.html) and
[images](https://orgmode.org/manual/Images.html)!

We can write arbitrary pieces of code within org documents, use
[org-babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/) to execute them
and [org-tangle](https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html)
to extract and create a source code file.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(message "Hello SERG from org-mode!")
```

Since we can mix text and code in org documents, it becomes trivial to
document experiments - complete with code snippets - which are
reproducible. In fact, org is a popular choice within the community to
document their emacs config. Yes, org-mode is basically Jupyter
notebooks in plaintext!

And the list goes on. Refer to the [org
manual](https://orgmode.org/manual/) for an exhaustive list of what org
can do.

# Closing Thoughts

> "Premature optimisation is the root of all evil." --- Donald Knuth

If you already have a system, methodology or tool that works for you,
stick with it! There is no point reinventing the wheel, especially if
you are content and productive with your existing system. You could also
be on the other end of the spectrum, where you spend a lot of time
configuring your system and tweaking your dotfiles!

That being said, if you are curious about emacs and want to learn more,
I would strongly suggest to first get in the right mindset and set
reasonable expectations. Emacs is not just another took, it's a way of
being. Learning everything that emacs has to offer will take a long time
(I have been using emacs full-time for over 3 years and I am still
learning new things!). Instead, start small, learn a small part of the
system which will help you get the job done. Iterate, and slowly craft
an environment that works for you.

## Additional Resources

A few resources and pointers to help you get started:

1.  Start with the tutorial: `C-h t`.
2.  Read the manual: `C-h r` or alternatively
    `C-h i` to open the documentation viewer (info) and
    select "Emacs".
3.  Use the excellent and extensive emacs help system, some of the most
    frequent ones that I use are: `C-h f`,
    `C-h v`, `C-h o` and `C-h m`.
4.  Consult the [emacs wiki](https://www.emacswiki.org/). I usually use
    it as reference once I have read about a particular topic in the
    manual.
5.  Watch Harry Schwartz's excellent talk on [getting started with
    org-mode](https://youtu.be/SzA2YODtgK4).
6.  Watch Howard Abrams' excellent talk on [emacs introduction and
    demonstration](https://youtu.be/B6jfrrwR10k).
7.  Consult my [emacs config
    files](https://github.com/arumoy-shome/emacs.d) if you prefer code.
