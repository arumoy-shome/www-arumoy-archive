Following is a list of talks I have given in the past.

# [2021-07-14 Wed] Research Workflow in Plaintext

I gave a talk to the [SERG](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/) and
[AFR](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/ai4fintech/) groups on managing
scientific work and crafting workflows in plaintext, using Emacs and
org-mode.
