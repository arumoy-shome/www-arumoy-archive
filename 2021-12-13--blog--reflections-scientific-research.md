I have been working as a researcher for several months now and have
been working towards my first publication for the past few
weeks. I have a few points of reflection on the scientific process and
what constitutes as a good researcher.

# Reading

This has been a challenge for me so far. I started my phd with
a literature review and during those initial 3 months I read a lot of
papers. However once the analysis started, the reading dropped down to
0 papers per week. I am not sure if it is possible to keep
a consistent reading practise, however reading at least 1 or 2 papers
per week is ideal. Reading not only helps to be inspired and spark new
ideas, but also makes for good content for the related work
& discussion section. Moving forward, I want to review recent
publications from the top journals of my field, and try to reflect
upon what they did well, what I will do differently and identify
interesting intersections between their topic and my research
interests.

# Writing

This was the first research project were I used my [org-mode
note-taking setup](LINKME) and I must say it went really well. When
the time came to start writing, I already had a pretty good outline
for report ready. One think that was still a challenge (at least for
the first week of writing) is that the process itself was very
slow. I don't think this can be helped/improved. This is simply my
process and all I can really do it work through it. Moving forward,
I will try to plan out content for the report throughout the project.

# Paper Discovery

This is relevant for reading & writing. I think my current system
works really well (see [scientific paper
discovery](2021-06-09--blog--scientific-paper-discovery)).

# Experimentation & Methodology

This could have been planned better. While writing the report
I realised several loops & flaws in my data collection and
methodology. My supervisor has recommended a book (see reference
below) which I will read prior to our next project. Moving forward,
I will also try to think about the dataset and its design earlier.

# General Thoughts & Remarks

I am curious to understand how my supervisor was able to see the
potential in the idea we ended up persuing vs. the ones I proposed. Is
this something that comes with experience? How can I spot a good
(scientific research) idea?
