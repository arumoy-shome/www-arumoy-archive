In this article I describe my process for discovering relevant and
important papers in a new scientific field. Since I am working towards
a doctoral degree, I need to read a lot to develop a deep
understanding of my field of research and stay current on the latest
developments.

# Where to Start

The starting point is always the most difficult. If possible, the best
place to start is through recommendation from your
peers/supervisor/advisor. If this is not possible, then coming up with
a few good keywords from your research question is the next best
approach. Reading a few non-scientific work (such as wikipedia) might
be necessary to obtain the "buzz words" of technical jargon which are
required to formulate the search queries.

The right way to familiarize oneself with a new field is through
a systematic literature review. However, I find that to be too big
a commitment for a new field of research (I may not stick with it if
I don't find it that interesting). So the smarter (and quicker way) to
familiarize oneself with the literature is to read the related papers.

# Finding More Papers

I categorise this search process into two parts: 1. Intrinsic and
2. Extrinsic.

We can find relevant papers from within the current paper we are
reading. This can be done by first reading the *related work* section
of the paper and second by reviewing the *reference* section of the
paper. The *related work* section often leads to papers that are at
a similar level of technical depth as the current paper. The papers in
the *reference* section tend to be more general and provide a good
high level overview of the field.

We can also find relevant papers from the search engine (Google
Scholar in my case). The *cited by* feature of GS is a good place to
find forward references or the papers which are citing the current
paper. These tend to be more specific and bleeding edge as they came
after the current paper. The *related articles* are also a good place
to find similar bodies of work. Google Scholar and Connected Papers
are good resources to explore this.

Usually, 5-10 good, well reputed papers is sufficient to start
with. And then, reading their related papers (and in turn their
related papers, so on and so forth as necessary), should result in
a collection of bibliography which paints a good picture of the field.

# Staying Current

One also needs to stay current on the field. For this, Google Scholar
alerts are a good start. By now the "position papers" and important
authors in the field should be known. Following these authors on
Google Scholar and creating an alert for when a position paper gets
cited is a good way to stay up to speed. Another approach is to keep
an eye on the relevant conferences and find papers directly from
there.

# Concluding Remarks and Acknowledgements

I was surprised to find that not a lot of information on this matter
is easily available. It is similar to how students are not taught how
to learn effectively, before they start attending university
classes. The emphasis on the "meta", the methodology of doing
something is lacking. I cannot take credit for the wisdom above, a lot
of it came from conversations with my peers and [Google Scholar help
website](https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/help.html).
