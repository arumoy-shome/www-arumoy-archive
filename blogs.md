This page contains links to some of my writings on topics that
interest me. Usually, they are inspired by problems that I experience
in my day-to-day life.

I like pondering over the act or the process of doing something.

To search my website using keywords, use a search engine. For
instance, in Google you can type `site:arumoy.me` followed by
your keywords to search within my blog posts. Your milage may vary as
I don't perform any SEO optimisation so the search engine may not have
indexed all my pages.

AIMS or Aru's Information Management System is a collection of
shellscripts to manage information in plaintext. It is inspired by
[org-mode](orgmode.org/), and tries to replicate a subset of its
functionalities which I frequently use. AIMS is completely tuned
towards my workflow as a researcher and how I manage my digital notes.
