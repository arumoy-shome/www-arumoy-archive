This page contains links to some of my writings on topics that
interest me. Usually, they are inspired by problems that I experience
in my day-to-day life.

I like pondering over the act or the process of doing something.

To search my website using keywords, use a search engine. For
instance, in Google you can type `site:arumoy.me` followed by
your keywords to search within my blog posts. Your milage may vary as
I don't perform any SEO optimisation so the search engine may not have
indexed all my pages.

# [2022-03-04 Fri 22:48] There and Back Again A Tale of Website Management

After years of using [orgmode](https://orgmode.org) along with the
[org-publish](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html)
package to run my website, I came back to markdown, shell & vim.

When you are staring at text all day long, little things such as the
colors of your terminal screen & text editor start to matter. There is
vast information & knowledge on color theory but very few colorscheme
authors take this into account.

AIMS or Aru's Information Management System is a collection of
shellscripts to manage information in plaintext. It is inspired by
[org-mode](orgmode.org/), and tries to replicate a subset of its
functionalities which I frequently use. AIMS is completely tuned
towards my workflow as a researcher and how I manage my digital notes.

# [2021-12-13 Mon 13:49] Reflections on Scientific Research

I have been working as a researcher for several months now and have
been working towards my first publication for the past few
weeks. I have a few points of reflection on the scientific process and
what constitutes as a good researcher.

# [2021-11-13 Sat 15:31] Computational Notebooks using Emacs & org-mode

I tried an experiment where I did data analysis in the
terminal. I wrote a python module consisting of all the analysis code
(where each method corresponds to a cell). I redirected the output to
files/images and viewed the results using unix commands/vim. I wrote
down my observations and interpretations of the results in a separate
markdown file.

# [2021-10-08 Fri 19:17] Ethics & AI

I attended the [ICAI](https://icai.ai/) session on *Ethics & AI*. It
was a really informative session which touched upon some very
interesting and intriguing topics. In this article, I share some of my
thoughts on the matter.

# [2021-08-01 Sun 15:12] Vim vs. Emacs

After 5 years of using vim, I switched to emacs in 2021. In this
article, I lay down some of my observations along with my rationale
for ultimately switching back to vim.

# [2021-06-09 Wed 16:26] Scientific Paper Discovery

In this article I describe my process for discovering relevant and
important papers in a new scientific field. Researchers need to read
a lot to develop a deep understanding of their field of research and
stay current on the latest developments.

# [2021-06-03 Thu 17:25] Research Workflow

Here I outline a workflow which I have developed to handle the
non-linear nature of scientific research. There are days when one
reads several papers without making much sense of them. However,
a single paper the next day can result in a clear picture of the
domain. The workflow acknowledges the fact that there are many more
failures rather than successes in research. However, a failure is
still an outcome---and this is what helps us decide what to do
next---so it should still be recorded.
